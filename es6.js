// // use let when you plan to reassign new values to a variable, and
// // use const when you donâ€™t plan on reassigning new values to a variable.
// Since const is the strictest way to declare a variable, we suggest that you always declare variables with const because it'll make your code easier to reason about since you know the identifiers won't change throughout the lifetime of your program.
// If you find that you need to update a variable or change it, then go back and switch it from const to let.
