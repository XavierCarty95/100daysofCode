The for...of loop is the most recent addition to the family of for loops in JavaScript.

It combines the strengths of its siblings, the for loop and the for...in loop, to loop over any type of data that is iterable (meaning it follows the iterable protocol which we'll look at in lesson 3). By default, this includes the data types String, Array, Map, and Set—notably absent from this list is the Object data type (i.e. {}). '

Objects are not iterable, by default.

use let when you plan to reassign new values to a variable, and
 use const when you don’t plan on reassigning new values to a variable.
 Since const is the strictest way to declare a variable, we suggest that you always declare variables with const because it'll make your code easier to reason about since you know the identifiers won't change throughout the lifetime of your program.
 If you find that you need to update a variable or change it, then go back and switch it from const to let.
